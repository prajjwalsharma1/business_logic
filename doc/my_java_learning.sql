Applets are intended to be small programs. They are typically used to display
data provided by the server, handle user input, or provide simple functions, such as a loan

Because servlets (like all Java programs) are compiled into bytecode and executed
by the JVM, they are highly portable. Thus, the same servlet can be used in a variety of
different server environments. The only requirements are that the server support the JVM
and a servlet container

To better understand how Java is robust, consider two of the main reasons for program
failure: memory management mistakes and mishandled exceptional conditions (that is,
run-time errors).


just a name is a memory allocation of the varibale  so it use the memory 

all tracedecial function return the double VALUE
The range of a char is 0 to 65,536. There are no negative chars
